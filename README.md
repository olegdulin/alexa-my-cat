## "My Cat" skill for Alexa

Our cat is a master manipulator and she always acts like she hasn't been fed in days. She is overweight and needs to be on a strict diet.

While I was learning how to program Alexa, I built a skill that I thought would help my family track of whether our cat has been fed or not. 

The idea is when a family member fed our cat, they can say: _"Alexa, tell My Cat I fed her_." Alexa would remember the time that the cat has been fed. Later on, another family member could say: _"Alexa, ask My Cat if I should feed her_" and Alexa would confirm whether the cat is indeed starving to death.

## Current status

I've tried submitting it to Alexa skill store but it got rejected with some minor suggestions. Unfortunately I don't have the time to fix everything. I don't want this skill sitting on my disk collecting dust though. I will post them as Github issues in the hope that someone else can contribute fixes.
